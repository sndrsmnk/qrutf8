qrutf8
======

Create TEXT-type QR-codes with UTF-8 and ANSI on consoles.

This is based on code from http://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/ by Markus Gutschke, Google. It requires libqrencode{2|3} to be installed but does not require that library's headers to compile since it uses dlopen().
